##  Hello, folks! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">
### Glad to see you here!
I'm Snehith Mangolu and I'm a **Frontend-first Full-stack developer who enjoys building things that don’t break in production (most days).** I'm based out of Hyderabad, India.

I’ve been shipping web and React Native apps since 2021. Over the years, my focus has shifted from just making things work to making them scale well, stay maintainable, and feel right for users.

I care about clean interfaces, predictable data flow, thoughtful architecture and code that someone else can read without silently judging me.

> "People don't care about what you say, they care about what you build." - Mark Zuckerberg

### 🌱 What I’m focusing on
- Building and scaling apps using React Native & React
- Strengthening full-stack skills while staying frontend-first
- Writing code that’s easier to maintain than to explain
- Improving performance, UX, and developer experience

### 🎬 When I’m not coding

I’m into screenwriting and short films — still storytelling, just without a debugger ✍️🎥
