##  Hello, folks! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">
### Glad to see you here!
I'm Snehith mangolu and I'm a **Front End Developer** with **UI/UX skills** based in Hyderabad, India.

I've been breathing and living web development since 2019, developing quality websites for nice people. I’ve been making every effort trying to perfect what I do and while I’ll never be perfect, I do my best to come close.

I'm always trying to grow and learn something new. Screen writing and shortfilms are some of my best interests in spare time. ✍️🎬

### What I'm focusing on 👨‍💻
I'm actively working on improving my React skills, also focusing on my backend development strengths.
